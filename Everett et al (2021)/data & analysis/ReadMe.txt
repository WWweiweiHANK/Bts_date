This repository contains all the experimental materials, data, and analysis scripts, for the experiments reported in Everett, J. A. C., Colombatto, C., ..., & Crockett, M. J. (2020) Moral dilemmas and trust in leaders during a global health crisis.

There are 3 main folders â€“ one ('Registered Report') for the main experiment reported in the paper, and two ('Pilot 1' and 'Pilot 2') for the pilots reported in the Supplementary Information in the paper.

Registered Report
  - Data & Analyses
    - .csv file containing anonymized and time stamped data
    - .R and .Rmd files (along with their .html rendering) containing code used to:
      (1) Download data from Qualtrics (CLP_RR_DataDownload; note that Qualtrics credentials were redacted)
      (2) Compute number of valid subjects in each country/task to monitor data collection progress (CLP_RR_LabLog)
      (3) Format/recode data (CLP_RR_DataCleaning; see 'Pre-processing' in the 'Analysis Plan' section of the paper for details)
      (4) Run the analyses (CLP_RR_Analysis; see 'Analysis plan for hypothesis testing' in the 'Analysis Plan' section of the paper for details; results are reported in the 'Main Analyses' and 'Exploratory Analyses' of the 'Results' section of the paper, and in Table 3)
      (5) Compute participant demographics and compare to quotas in population (CLP_RR_PartInfo; see 'Participants' and 'Representativeness' in the 'Results' section of the paper for details; results are reported in Supplementary Table 2, and depicted in Supplementary Figures 7-8)
      (6) Create the figures reported in the paper (CLP_RR_Plots; depicted in Figures 3-5)
    - .txt file containing quotas (i.e. % population in each gender/age category) used by participant demographics script for evaluation of representativeness
    - .xlsx file containing number of valid subjects in each country/task for each day of data collection LabLog script
  - Power Analyses
    - .R files containing code to run the power analyses for the self-report (CLP_Pilot2_Power_SR) and voting (CLP_Pilot2_Power_VT) tasks (see 'Sampling Plan' in the 'Power analysis' section of the paper for details)
    - .batch files containing code to launch power analyses computations; information about the server was removed for blind peer review
    - .csv files containing power analyses results generated by power analysis scrips
  - Surveys
    - .docx and .pdf files containing the surveys participants in each country completed (see 'Design' section of the paper and Figure 2 for details); both English and translated versions are provided where applicable (see 'Translations' in the 'Design' section of the paper for details)
  - Stage 1 Materials
    - Code/.Rmd file (along with its .html rendering) containing analysis code pre-registered at Stage 1
    - Data/.csv file containing dummy data to run pre-registered analysis code
    - Survey/.docx, .qsf, and .pdf files containing the surveys pre-registered at Stage 1 for the donation experiment (CLP_RR_DonationsTask_Redacted) and the English version of the main experiment (CLP_RR_MasterSurvey_Redacted); information about authors and institutions was removed for blind peer review

Pilot experiments
  - Code
    - .Rmd files (along with their .html rendering) containing code used to:
      (1) format/recode data downloaded from Qualtrics (CLP_Pilot1_DataPrep, and CLP_Pilot2_DataPrep)
      (2) run the analyses and create the figures reported in the paper (CLP_Pilot1_Analysis, and CLP_Pilot2_Analysis; results are reported in the 'Pilot Data' section of the Supplementary Information)
  - Data
    - .csv files containing anonymized data and used by analysis scripts
  - Plots
    - .jpeg and .pdf files generated by analysis scripts (depicted in Supplementary Figures 2-6)
  - Survey
    - .docx, .pdf, and .qsf files containing the surveys participants completed (see 'Design' section of the paper for details); information about authors and institutions was removed for blind peer review
