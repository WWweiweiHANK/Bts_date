# Purpose

The purpose of this script is to create the analysis dataset for PSA004 / CREP_Turri. 

Inputs (all in the "data" directory)
 - data_sss_final.csv - SoSciSurvey dataset
 - b6c8ec_with_order.csv - b6c8ec Qualtrics dataset with display order information
 - 87d100_with_order.csv - 87d100 Qualtrics dataset with display order information
 - lab_countries.csv - mapping of lab ids to countries

Outputs:
- "csv/d_all_long.csv" all analysis data, long
- "csv/d_all.csv" all analysis data, wide
- "csv/d_dge_valid.csv" analysis data, valid cases only, wide (note this has been updated to not run)
- "csv/d_dge_valid_long.csv" analysis data, valid cases only, wide (note this has been updated to not run)
- "previous.csv" and other datasets for open-ended coding
= "purpose.csv" and other datasets for open-ended coding

Ideally, we'd read in the variable mappings for QT data rather than typing them manually. 

# Data Deidentification (EMB)

- I deidentified labs as requested by giving them 5 digit unique codes and find/replaced/rewrote the data with the updated lab codes in `lab_countries.csv` and `data_sss_final.csv`.
- I don't believe I did anything to the original data in `87d100_with_order.csv` - just changed the name of the file to deidentify the lab code.
- For the `b6c8ec_with_order.csv` data, I deidentified the lab code name and removed all the information from the IP, Lat, Long, and turk columns to deidentify that dataset.

#' of the shape `cond_{g,k,i}_{variable}`, e.g., `cond_g_luck_vas` for the
#' luck/ability judgement for whichever vignette was presented in the Gettier
#' condition. This works for all variables in `vig_dvs`, i.e. `know_vas`,
