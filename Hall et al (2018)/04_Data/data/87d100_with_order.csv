 This is an academic research study created by researchers in the Department of Psychology at University of Arizona. As a participant in this study, you will read three different stories about other people. You will then answer some questions about these stories, followed by some questions about yourself. 

 

 In order to participate in this survey, you must be 18 years of age or older, live in the United States, and you must be able to read in English. This survey is anonymous, meaning that we will not ask for your name or any other personally identifying information. You will be compensated with 1 research credits for every 30 minutes of participation. We do not foresee any risks in participating in this study.  The version of the study you are participating in will take 15-20 minutes and you will only be participating in ONE version of the study.

 

Your participation is entirely voluntary, so you may withdraw your consent for any reason and at any time you wish to do so.  Whether or not you take part in and complete the project has no bearing whatsoever on your treatment or standing within the UA Psychology Department. You will be fully compensated for your time even if you decide to withdraw from the study. Data from any participant who has withdrawn consent will not be included in data analyses.

 

If at any point you decide that you no longer wish to participate, you can stop taking the survey at any time. If you have any questions about this survey, feel free to email the Primary Investigator, Alyssa Croft, Ph.D., at alyssac@email.arizona.edu or co-investigator Alexander Danvers, Ph.D., at adanvers@email.arizona.edu.  

 



 In line with current best practices in psychological research, electronic data will be preserved for future use in open science initiatives. No information that identifies you will be saved or used for any purpose other than to give you course credit. Open science initiatives allow for researchers from different universities to share their data upon completion of studies, in an effort to stimulate further use and exploration of existing data sets. Data is uploaded to the Open Science Framework (http://centerforopenscience.org/), an online forum, in the form of a computer software file, and these files are stripped of any information that could identify participants (e.g., names, email addresses), to ensure confidentiality. All raw data will be stored on a password-protected computer and secure, encrypted servers at the UA campus. Only the Principal Investigator, Dr. Alyssa Croft, authorized research lab personnel and the University of Arizona Institutional Review Board will have access to this information.



There are no foreseen risks associated with this study and there is minimal deception involved in the form of hypothesis concealment (necessary to avoid demand characteristics in participants). Refusal to participate or withdrawal/dropout after agreeing to participate will not have an adverse effect or consequences on the participants. The full purpose of the study will be explained to all participants at the end of the session, and participants will have the option to withdraw their data if they so choose.

 

The information that you provide in the study will be handled confidentially. However, there may be circumstances where this information must be released or shared as required by law. The University of Arizona Institutional Review Board may review the research records for monitoring purposes.

 

For questions about your rights as a participant in this study or to discuss other study-related concerns or complaints with someone who is not part of the research team, you may contact the Human Subjects Protection Program at 520-626-6721, at vpr-irb@email.arizona.edu, or online at http://rgw.arizona.edu/compliance/human-subjects-protection-program

 

An Institutional Review Board responsible for human subjects research at The University of Arizona reviewed this research project and found it to be acceptable, according to applicable state and federal regulations and University policies designed to protect the rights and welfare of participants in research.
