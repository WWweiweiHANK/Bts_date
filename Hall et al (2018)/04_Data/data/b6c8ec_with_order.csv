This study is conducted by Gilad Feldman and colleagues at the Department of Psychology of the University of Hong Kong. If you have questions or concerns regarding this project, please do not hesitate to contact Gilad Feldman at gfeldman@hku.hk at any time.



Purpose of the study

This study is on what people think another person knows.



Procedures

You will read three stories about people, then you will answer a few questions about these stories, followed by a very brief questionnaire about yourself. Survey time is indicated on MTurk task you accepted.



Potential risks

There are no known risks to you greater than those of ordinary daily life.



Potential benefits

Other than the monetary compensation, we do not anticipate any direct benefit to you in exchange for participation. This study aims to add to scientific knowledge about how language works. We also hope that this study can provide you with a learning experience of participating in psychological research and possibly learning more about yourself and your beliefs and evaluations.



Compensation

Compensation is offered through the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. The level of compensation has been indicated on the Amazon Mechanical Turk HIT that you accepted.



Confidentiality

Your questionnaire responses are anonymous and strictly confidential. No personal identifiers are kept. Information obtained will only be used as aggregates for research purposes. Results from this study will be used for further research and may be reported in a department, campus, regional, or national meeting or published in a journal. Deidentified (anonymous) data will also be made available on a public repository (osf.io).



Participation and withdrawal

Your participation is voluntary. This means that you can choose to stop at any time without negative consequences. If at any time you wish to withdraw, please simply indicate eight zeros as your completion code on MTurk, and you will receive compensation regardless.



Questions and concerns

If you have any questions about the research, please feel free to contact Gilad Feldman at the University of Hong Kong (gfeldman@hku.hk). If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, please contact the Human Research Ethics Committee, HKU (+852 2241 5267).
