Assessing Language

 

Principal Investigator: Dr. Jennifer Beaudry, Senior Lecturer, Department of Psychological Sciences, Faculty of Health, Arts, and Design, Swinburne University of Technology

Student Investigator: Elian Thiele-Evans, Department of Psychological Sciences, Faculty of Health, Arts, and Design, Swinburne University of Technology

 

Introduction to Project

You are invited to participate in a research project being conducted by Dr. Jennifer Beaudry of the Faculty of Health, Arts, and Design, Swinburne University of Technology. You must be at least 18 years of age to participate.

 

About this Project

This is a study about assessing languages. You will be asked to read several stories and answer questions about each story. You will then be asked several questions about your experience as a participant in this study and demographic questions (e.g., age, gender). The entire study should take less than 30 minutes to complete.

 

Participants Rights and Interests

Risks of Participation

There are no known risks for participating in the current study. Furthermore, as your participation is voluntary, you may refuse to answer any questions, and can discontinue participation at any time with no penalty.

 

Benefits of Participation

Participating in this study will give you experience with psychological research, which will be useful during your coursework in Psychology. In addition, given that you are participating through the Research Experience Program, you will receive 0.5 REP credits. You may withdraw from the study at any time and still receive full credit.

 

Withdrawal from Participation

Your participation in the current study is completely voluntary. You may refuse to participate with no penalty. You have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any penalty or prejudice from the researchers. You are not obligated to answer any question.

 

Privacy and Confidentiality

Your responses will be completely anonymous, and thus will have no identifying characteristics. This anonymised data will be made available to other researchers online through data sharing platforms (e.g., Open Science Framework; osf.io).

 

Research Output

The summary results of this study may be presented, for academic purposes at conferences, lectures, etc., and may be published in academic journals. Your responses will not be identifiable in any of these research outputs. Anonymised data will be uploaded to the data sharing platforms (e.g., Open Science Framework; osf.io) and shared with lead researchers at Avila University. If you would like a report of the final results, please contact the principal investigator (details below) in one year.

 

*** Please conduct this study only once. At the end of this study, we will provide you with a code on the debriefing page that you must send to beaudrylab@swin.edu.au to obtain REP credit. We will grant you credit within 48 hours of you sending this code to us. If you do not receive credit after this period, please email us.***

Purpose is to identify whether people are concerned if things are real or not and what impact the outcome may play. Obviously, in the diamond story, Emma will get ripped off financially if she purchases a fake diamond. A real consequence. But does it really matter if the house is fake or not? Only to the people who were living in the real houses, not in the context of this story. It also matters, from a research point of view whether the animal seen was a squirrel or not.
