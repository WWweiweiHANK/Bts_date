"s636","eng","I honestly have no clue. My gut tells me it has something to do with if we believe or know what the people in the readings feel one way or another, or the study has something to do with us reading the passages and then based on those passages how we answer these questions in terms of unconfident (believes) or confident (knows) to see if the ideas in our minds carry on after the study has supposedly ended."

"s700","eng","Well I thought that it was about """"""""knowing"""""""" vs. """"""""believing,"""""""" but half of the questions are now about how I felt and what I think the purpose is, so now I don't think it has anything to do with those first questions and instead, it's something tricky about how we took the study.

"s757","eng","To figure out what people really think they know and how confident they are in what they think they know, even though the possibility to be wrong is always present."
"s760","eng","I believe the purpose of this study is to show people that there are many things that people believe 
are true, but in reality aren't and vice versa. This study could also have the purpose of examining people to see if they themselves are able to understand the difference between something that is believed to be true and something that is actually true."
"s761","eng","I believe the purpose of this study was to show people that you can't always trust what you believe."

"s776","eng","I think the purpose of this study was to see what {Category:} think others are aware of."
"s795","eng","To see how {Category:} perceive and belief things "
"s796","eng","I think this study is focusing on the perspective of individuals in the fictional scenarios, as well as our perspective in being the all-knowing reader. Due to the fact that the reader has all of the information from the story, it is easy to see the explanations behind the choices and thinking made by each character in the different scenarios. I think the idea in understanding all sides of one's perspectives would limit the disagreements in today's world. For instance, the story with the father and son driving through the tornado town. The father thought he was pointing at a real house, but it was in fact a fake house. Since it was evident to the reader that he was unaware of the recent tornado that had ripped through the town, it is easy to understand his belief. If the reader did not know this information, it could be highly likely that they think the father is not very intelligent because he can't tell the difference between a fake and real house. The study is all about gaining every angle on someone's belief, before making judgement upon them."
